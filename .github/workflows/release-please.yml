            You are writing release notes for Nametag, a personal relationships manager web app.

            Here are the commits since the last release:
            ---
            ${{ steps.commits.outputs.commit_log }}
            ---

            Write a SHORT release summary for end users. This is critical — keep it brief.

            Format: a flat markdown bullet list. No headings, no sections, no preamble.
            - 3-6 bullet points MAXIMUM. Combine related commits into one bullet.
            - One short sentence per bullet (under 20 words). Start with a verb (Added, Fixed, Improved).
            - Write from the user's perspective: what changed for them.
            - Only mention breaking changes if there are any — prefix with "**Breaking:**".
            - Do NOT include commit hashes, component names, or technical jargon.
            - Do NOT include invisible changes (refactoring, CI, tests, translations).
            - Do NOT add a title, header, or sign-off. Just the bullets.
