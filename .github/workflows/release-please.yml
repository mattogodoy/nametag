            You are writing release notes for Nametag, a personal relationships manager web app.

            Here are the commits since the last release:
            ---
            $(cat /tmp/commits.txt)
            ---

            Write a concise release summary for end users. Rules:
            - Group changes by THEME (e.g., "Contact Sync", "UI Polish"), NOT by commit type
            - Write from the user's perspective: what they gain, what's fixed
            - 3-8 bullet points total
            - Start each bullet with a verb (Added, Fixed, Improved, etc.)
            - If there are breaking changes, put them first under a "Breaking Changes" heading
            - Do NOT include commit hashes or technical jargon
            - Do NOT include changes that are invisible to users (refactoring, CI, tests)
            - Use markdown formatting
